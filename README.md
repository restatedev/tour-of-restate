# A Tour of Restate

Restate is a system for easily building resilient applications using **distributed durable RPC & async/await**.

This repository contains the code examples for the `Tour of Restate` tutorial, for the Typescript Handler API and Java SDK.
This tutorial takes your through key Restate features by developing an end-to-end ticketing app.

## Releasing

To create a new release, push a tag of the form `vX.Y.Z`.
